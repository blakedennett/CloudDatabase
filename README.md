# Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn some of the ground-work to cloud databases.  

I imported the firebase admin and used a private key to set up credentials. Then I made a function to add 
a document with fields, read a document, and delete a document.

# Cloud Database

This is a simple database that describes a few CrossFit workouts with each movement.

# Development Environment

The tools I used were Google's Firestore, Python, and Visual Studio Code.

# Future Work

In the future I would like to better understand some of the standards that companies use to 
build, maintain and organize these databases
